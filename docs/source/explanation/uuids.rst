AFL-automation UUIDs
=========================

This page explains the different kinds of UUIDs used in AFL-automation and an eccentric feature thereof.

Kinds of UUIDs
--------------

UUIDs appear in at least four places in AFL-automation, and to distinguish the uses, we prepend two characters and a hyphen to the standard UUID:

1. **Queue Daemon (QD-)**: uuid of a task in a queue.  Returned by `Driver.enqueue` and used to retrieve status and results.
2. **Sample (SA-)**: uuid of a specific sample, either generated on the client and passed into `Driver.set_sample` or generated by `Driver.set_sample` automatically.  Used to cross-reference tasks across servers. See :doc:`/explanation/data`
3. **Dropbox (DB-)**: uuid of an item a server has deposited in its dropbox, used for storage and transfer of large objects that would be impractical to json-serialize and store in logs.
4. **I FORGET** : uuid of something else I forget
