AFL-automation is a framework for instrument control and laboratory automation. It powers the NIST AFL (Autonomous Formulation Laboratory), but is designed to be versatile for many scientific instrumentation needs. It enables the easy conversion of Python classes - drivers - into robust HTTP microservices with authentication, task queueing, UI generation, data management, and more.
