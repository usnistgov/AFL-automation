Welcome to AFL-automation's documentation!
==========================================

AFL-automation is a framework for instrument control.  It powers the NIST AFL, but is more useful than that.  It enables the easy conversion of Python classes - drivers - into robust HTTP microservices with authentication, task queueing, UI generation, data management, and more.
